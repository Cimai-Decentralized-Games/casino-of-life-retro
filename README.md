## **Introduction**  
The `casino-of-life-retro` package is a revolutionary tool developed by **Cimai** as part of its decentralized gaming ecosystem. This package acts as a bridge between retro gaming environments powered by [Stable-Retro](https://stable-retro.farama.org/) and customizable AI agents built using [Eliza](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/intro/). Designed to democratize game AI development, this package allows developers, educators, and hobbyists to create, train, and deploy intelligent agents in retro games with ease.  

The `casino-of-life-retro` package is central to **Cimai's Casino of Life**, a platform where retro gaming meets cutting-edge reinforcement learning (RL) to create a new genre of esports.
